🧬 Genetic Algorithm – Shakespeare Monkey Theorem

This project is a simple yet fascinating demonstration of how genetic algorithms can evolve random strings of characters toward a target phrase, inspired by the Infinite Monkey Theorem — the idea that an infinite number of monkeys randomly typing on keyboards would eventually reproduce the complete works of Shakespeare.

📘 Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate evolutionary optimization in a playful way.
A population of random strings (chromosomes) evolves over generations through selection, crossover, and mutation until it perfectly matches a target sentence (for example: "To be or not to be").

This concept is commonly known as the Shakespeare Monkey Problem, and it beautifully illustrates how randomness, guided by selection pressure, can lead to order and intelligent results over time.

⚙️ How It Works

Initialization
A population of random strings is generated, each with the same length as the target phrase.

Fitness Evaluation
Each individual is evaluated based on how many characters match the target phrase (character-by-character similarity).

Selection
The best individuals (highest fitness) are selected to reproduce.

Crossover
Two parents combine parts of their strings to create offspring.

Mutation
Random characters are occasionally altered to maintain diversity in the population.

Termination
The algorithm repeats until an individual exactly matches the target phrase or a maximum number of generations is reached.

💻 Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Core libraries:

random

string

matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

▶️ Running the Project
Option 1 – Using Jupyter Notebook

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/genetic-algorithm-shakespeare.git


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Genetic Algorithm (Shakespeare Monkey Theorem).ipynb"


Run all cells to see the algorithm evolve the population step by step.

Option 2 – Running as a Python Script

If you prefer, you can export the notebook as a .py file and execute it directly:

python monkey_theorem.py

🧠 Example Output
Generation 0: Evgmzstji pxt!wzc
Generation 27: To bq or nol to bz
Generation 36: To be or not to be


The algorithm gradually converges to the exact phrase, showing how evolutionary pressure can guide random processes toward meaningful results.

📊 Customization

You can easily modify:

Target phrase → change the text to evolve toward.

Population size

Mutation rate

Crossover rate

Maximum generations

These parameters strongly influence convergence speed and stability.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add real-time plotting of fitness evolution.

Visualize mutation and crossover dynamics.

Experiment with multi-objective optimization.

Compare performance with other evolutionary algorithms.
